This project controls a lamp inside my room, as well as 1 LED and a screen that allow you to write short text (in English). The circuit is connected to a static HTML website.

<h3>Inspiration, "Erez's Camera"</h3>
<p>

Several years ago, I came across a project called "Erez's Camera". The project provided control to turn on and off two lamps in a room through a website. From what I researched, the project used an LPT connection and the website displayed either a JAVA or FLASH application for streaming.<br>
I visited this project from time to time and enjoyed turning the lamps on and off in the room (there was even a message once asking me to turn off the lamps because it was noon and he wanted to sleep üòä.<br>

<h3>Installation, all the physical equipment</h3>
<h4>In practice, the project was divided into 2 projects</h4>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Working with (COM) SERIAL PORT (as old school used to work).</li>
  <li>Working with IOT (which stands for Internet Of Things, an apparatus to follow).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>The hardware used in this project</h4>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Arduino Uno</li>
  <li>Arduino MKR WiFi 1010</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>The following cameras were purchased for actual documentation, real-time streaming</h4>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Logitech C922 PRO HD<br>
    The project was implemented initially with this camera.
  </li>
  <li>
    Logitech Brio 4K<br>
    Purchased for my personal use, if the project received a good camera, then I also deserve one
  </li>
  <li>
    Ezviz C3N<br>
    Today, the project is implemented with an IP camera that initially started with a network connection (via Ethernet). Today, it is connected with WIFI. It is a very good camera in relation to its price compared to USB cameras, but it is weaker for its intended use (security).

<p>
I needed to attach PRO camera lenses to the IP camera in order to display images of an object placed close to it and to reduce the glare of a lamp.<br>
I used +2 lenses and a UV filter (taking into account that the camera itself has a fish eye lens). And yes, there are purple-colored lenses :D<br>

<p>
Attempts, trials, and glimpses at my computer screen during learning.<br>
The Serial Port version was the first one developed on the Arduino Uno, and it was the most challenging in terms of programming.<br>
I didn't expect to have to learn so much about the streaming world, and in addition, I only added the IP camera because I wanted some privacy and to distance the Arduino from me üòÅ<br>
